    """Pre-tool-use hook that nudges the agent toward Serena's symbolic tools.

    Tracks consecutive uses of grep and read-file tools via a persisted
    :class:`ToolUseCounter`. When the number of recent calls reaches the
    configured threshold, a deny response is emitted with a reminder to
    use symbolic alternatives.

    The counter for a given tool type is reset whenever

    * a Serena tool is invoked (both counters are reset),
    * a deny is emitted (the acting counter is reset so the next retry starts fresh),
    * or the configured reset period elapses *between two consecutive calls of that
      same tool type* — i.e. the period gates the gap between successive calls, not
      an absolute sliding window. Three grep calls at t=0, t=9, t=18 therefore count
      as a burst of three, even though the total span (18s) exceeds the 10s grep
      period; only an individual pair that is more than 10s apart resets the counter.

    Non-tracked tools (Edit, Write, Bash, etc.) are deliberately neutral: they neither
    increment nor reset counters, so they also do not mask bursts by pushing the last
    timestamp forward.

    The hook is additionally gated by :attr:`ToolUseCounter._MIN_DENY_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
    (two minutes by default): once a deny has been emitted, *every* subsequent
    invocation of this hook is a no-op until the window has elapsed — neither the
    counters are updated nor any further deny is produced. This prevents the agent
    from being nudged more than once per window during a sustained non-symbolic-tool
    burst, and also avoids surprising the user with reminders that were already
    counted up under stale state.
